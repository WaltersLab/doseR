## Welcome to the webpage for _doseR_

*doseR* is bioinformatics software primarily designed for analysis of sex chromosome dosage compensation using RNA-seq data. However, the software package and underlying statistical framework can be applied broadly to detect shifts in gene expression among an arbitray number of pre-defined groups of loci.

The *doseR* package, implemented in R as part of the bioconductor project, is being developed in the [Walters Lab](http://walterslab.org/) at the University of Kansas. The project is funded by the National Science Foundation (ABI-1661454, beginning September, 2017). The work will be done in close collaboration with [Thomas Hardcastle](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/tjh48/) at the University of Cambridge. 

The software is currently in early stages of development and not yet ready for public release. Examples of the underlying principle can be found in the following publications:
