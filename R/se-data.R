#' @references To demonstrate a typical workflow using doseR, we will use
#' data from a study in Heliconius butterflies.  H. melpomene
#' has 20 autosomes with chromosome 21 being the "Z" sex chromosome.
#' Like all Lepidoptera, this is a female-heterogametic species, so males
#' are diploid for the Z while females have a single Z and W chromosomes.
#' The relevant data are included in the doseR package, which must be installed.
#' These test data are unpublished. This is the SummarizedExperiment version of
#' the sample data.
