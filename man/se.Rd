Hmel data set

To demonstrate a typical workflow using doseR, we will use
data from a study in Heliconius butterflies.  H. melpomene
has 20 autosomes with chromosome 21 being the "Z" sex chromosome.
Like all Lepidoptera, this is a female-heterogametic species, so males
are diploid for the Z while females have a single Z and W chromosomes.
The relevant data are included in the doseR package, which must be installed.
These test data are unpublished. This is the SummarizedExperiment version of
the sample data.
